## Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

* I’m learning about data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. I’m using various online resources and going to be sharing my notes as a series of blog posts. The topics are below:

### Data Structures
* [List ADT](http://www.tamrat.co/list-adt-data-structures-algorithms-in-javascript-p-1/)
* [Stacks](http://www.tamrat.co/stacks-data-structures-algorithms-in-javascript-p-2/)
* [Queues](http://www.tamrat.co/queues-data-structures-algorithms-in-javascript-p-3/)
* [Linked Lists](http://www.tamrat.co/linked-list-data-structures-algorithms-in-javascript-p-4/)
* Trees, Tries & Graphs
* Heaps
* Hash Tables


### Algorithms
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth-First Search
* Binary Search
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

### Concepts
* Memory (Stack vs. Heap)
* Recursion
* Big O Time & Space

### Why even learn Data Structures & Algorithms?

* Quite simply because **Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs** (Niklau)
* Any program is going to need some type of data structure to store and manage the data that it is manipulating and one or more algorithms for translating that data from its input form to its output form.
* There is always more than one data structure or algorithm for a particular problem so studying the pros and cons of each type is a critical skill for a programmer.

* This project is made at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), where I am currently learning programming.
